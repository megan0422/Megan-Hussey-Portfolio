# Final Project, Part 2
For this part of my final project, I put together a wireframe detailing the order of my presentation, transferred that into a rough draft on shorthand (storyboard), and conducted interviews as part of user research. 

### Wireframeüï∏Ô∏è
Below is the sketch of my initial wireframe. The first data visualization is one of the sketches from the [first part of the final project](https://megan0422.github.io/Megan-Hussey-Portfolio/finalproject1) (world plastic production from 1950-2015). I decided to not use the world map as my second data visualization, as I feel that it does not encompass a shock factor. Truly, it doesn't matter how much plastic each country produces for the purposes of my presentation.

### Storyboardüìñ
I created a rough draft of my final presentation in shorthand, trying to follow the structure I set up in my wireframe. One thing I found difficult when creating the rough draft was balancing too many words vs. visuals since copyright free images are limited.

### Interviewsüë©‚Äçüíª
**Target Audience:**
My target audience for this presentation is people that care about the environment generally and have a motivation to help. 

As part of my user research, I presented my storyboard to three individuals and gathered their responses to the following questions. My goals/intent for asking these questions is also included. 

| Question | Goal |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. What are your initial takeaways? | Figuring out what people are left with at the conclusion of my presentation. |
| 2.	What struck your eye? | To understand how people interact with my story at first glance. |
| 3.	Was there anything that confused you? | Hoping to find areas that need to be clarified for my audience. |
| 4.	Would you do anything differently? | Similar to the last question, but hoping to pick people's brains about areas for improvement, especially given that my target audience is already environmentally conscious. |
| 5.	Who do you think is the target audience and would it reach them well? | Hoping to understand if the tone of my presentation is targeting the correct audience (environmentally conscious people). |
| 6.	How was the use of imagery? | Wondering if my images are distracting or add to the overall theme of my project. | 

To ensure I interviewed a diverse set of perspectives, I spoke to two individuals in their 20s and one individual in their 50s. Their responses to these questions are documented in the table below. 

| Question | Person 1 (female, 24 years) | Person 2 (female, 58 years)
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Initial takeaways | It makes me feel bad about the pollution of plastic in the ocean and the ways I contribute. The 90% statistics were especially alarming. | I already knew quite a bit about plastic and recycling plastic but my initial thoughts are that we need to use less plastic, however, the petroleum lobby is really the problem. They created the myth of recycling. |
| Things that struck your eye | The big bar graph about the growth of plastic production since the 1950s. It has been very continuous. | The graph that shows the exponential growth of plastic production. | 
| Things you found confusing | Nothing was super confusing but you didn‚Äôt focus on nurdles until the end. Are all nurdles microplastics or are all microplastics nurdles? The transition needs to be clarified. | Why is so little plastic recycled? Is it because people don‚Äôt try? Or can most plastic not be recycled? That needs to be clarified. |
| Things you would do differently | Could you visualize some of your statistics instead of just spelling them out for the audience? It was a little hard to follow all the words so quickly. | I would put in a picture of nurdles. I think I‚Äôm having trouble understanding what they are still. Maybe include a dimension. |
| Target audience | People who care about the environment, with a sub focus on people who have time and money to care about the environment. I do think it reaches them well. | Anybody that cares about the environment. I think it would resonate with them well. |
| Use of imagery | I thought your use of imagery was incredibly powerful. | In general, it was good. But I am still left wondering what a nurdle really looks like. |
