# Final Project, Part 2
For this part of my final project, I put together a wireframe detailing the order of my presentation, transferred that into a rough draft on shorthand (storyboard), and conducted interviews as part of user research. 

### Wireframe
Below is the sketch of my initial wireframe. The first data visualization is one of the sketches from the [first part of the final project](https://megan0422.github.io/Megan-Hussey-Portfolio/finalproject1) (world plastic production from 1950-2015). I decided to not use the world map as my second data visualization, as I feel that it does not encompass a shock factor. Truly, it doesn't matter how much plastic each country produces for the purposes of my presentation.
