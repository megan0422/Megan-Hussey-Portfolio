This visualization was created with Flourish to depict government debt per total GDP of the country.

This visualization was created with Flourish to show the data from visuals 1 and 2 in a different way. This time, government debt per total GDP of the country is depicted with a circle map, with countries with higher debt ratios given bigger circles. The drop down menu gives an option to see totals (over the period 1995-2021), or select the year. 

### Writeup: 
This exercise walked through ways to depict the same data differently. The dataset used was the OECD government debt data, which depicts general government debt-to-GDP ratio by country in different time periods. The ratio is the total debt percentage of the country's GDP, so countries with ratios above 100% have more debt than their total GDP. The first visualization shows a simple bar chart in one time period. We had to pick one of the more recent years with the most data to show in our final visual because it is difficult to show different time periods in bar charts. The second visual is a gridded line plot, with each country getting it's own line plot depicting how the debt to GDP ratio rises and falls over the years. This shows a more comprehensive outlook of the data than our first visual, but the tradeoff is that it is much busier. Essentially, it is very difficult to interpret each tiny line plot at first glance. 

The third and final visual is a circle map of the highest and lowest debt to GDP ratios by country, with the higher debt ratios depicted as larger circles in the center of the page. For this visual, I grouped by year, so that the viewer has the ability to choose the year they want depicted in the dropdown menu. There is also an "all" option, which summed the ratios for all years per country. This shows a different story than in our other two visuals, allowing the viewer to look at overall ratios and also per year. However, like the gridded line charts, this visual may be very overwhelming at first glance. It also looks more categorical than quantitative, which can be both good and bad depending on the audience we are attempting to appeal to. Finally, while I changed some of the colors in the palette, it was difficult to choose different colors for each country while still matching a similar palette. This is because of the large number of countries in our dataset. This highlights the difficulty with using colors to categorize data when you have lots of categories/labels.
