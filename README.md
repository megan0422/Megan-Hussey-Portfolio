# About me
Hello! My name is Megan Hussey (she/her) and I am a second year Master of Public Policy and Management student in the Data Analytics track at Carnegie Mellon University. I am originally from just outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and I attended St. Olaf College, a liberal arts college in a small farm town about 40 minutes south of the Twin Cities. I decided to pursue a degree in policy following a gap year of service with AmeriCorps VISTA. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and watching reality TV shows with my roommates, going to spin classes, and checking out local breweries in the Pittsburgh area. 

# What I hope to learn
I feel very confident in my ability to work with and synthesize data, but I am excited to learn how to create more compelling and clean visualizations.
