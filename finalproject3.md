# Final Project, Part 3
For the final part of my final project, I finished my website on shorthand using data from the user research I completed and presented to my class.

Make sure to check out parts 1 and 2 of my final project before reading on if you haven't already!

## What I changed‚ú®
After receiving user feedback in part 2, I set out to make changes in order of most feasible with the highest value to the reader. This is detailed on the graph made at the bottom of part 2. My first two priorities were using more visuals (including some sort of size dimension comparison for a microplastic) and finding a better quality picture of nurdles. 

#### More visuals representations of numbers and sizesüñºÔ∏è
The two visuals I made were on [infogram](https://infogram.com), with one being a pictoral representation of a percentage (only 9% of all plastic being recylced annually) and the other being a size comparison. The pictoral representation of 9% was pretty simple to create, and I was even able to customize my icon to be a plastic water bottle. 

The size comparison infogram was a little bit trickier to create, because I had to do some googling and estimating of common things that people could imagine in their head that could be easily measured in millimeters. I ended up choosing a penny (which is about 20 millimeters in diameter), so I made the size comparison by manually entering in data of 20 to 5. I verbally told my audience that the microplastic could be that size *or smaller*. I had to make a note of that on my website so people not listening to me present could also understand that the microplastic could be that size *or less*. 

Below is the size comparison visual I made.

#### Finding a nurdle pictureüåä
A big challenge was finding a copyright free image of nurdles. Because nurdles are not widely known, I quickly learned that finding them on unsplash would not an option. I ended up finding images on Wikimedia Commons that had a permission to reshare, contigent on giving credit. This ended up helping my final product greatly, both in terms of clarifying for people what a nurdle was and also doing the topic itself justice. 

Here are the links to the images I ended up using:

Adding both the from infogram and a better nurdle picture helped with my **clarifications** component people requested for the usesr interviews. In particular, people were confused on nurdles and their size. The size comparison visual and better pictures of nurdles helped tremendously with clarifying that. 

## Targeting my audienceüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß
I knew from conducting my interviews that I was targeting environmentally conscious people who had the time and effort to help. Because of this, I felt that I didn't need much background introduction to climate change and how it affects our oceans. During my presentation, I also didn't spend much time introducing the problem of plastic pollution, I just jumped right in to show the alarming data of the growth of plastic production. My third interviewee also told me she felt like it was very targeted towards students. To a certain extend, I agreed. Even though I believe climate change reform requires system-wide interventions, I felt like it was important to leave my audience with concrete, actionable steps that can be taken *today*.

## What I learnedüß†
Overall, this project was a lot of fun for me to complete. Here are some of the biggest takeaways from this project: 

1. **Just because you can do more complex visualizations, doesn't mean you should.** This reminds me of what we talked about early on in the class - just because you have all the data, doesn't mean you should try to include it all. I tried to make more complex visuals early on, including a world map of plastic production. Ultimately, I decided to keep things simpler with using bar graphs and the infograms I made. I wanted people to focus on the story rather than trying to puzzle out the data.
2.  **Environmental/climate data is very hard to locate and often incomplete.** When I decided on topics, I didn't imagine nurdles and microplastics would be nearly impossible to find data on. Because microplastics are so abundant and almost everywhere, I imagine it is very hard to estimate the true scale of the problem with data. Ultimately, being able to start big picture with plastics, then move to microplastics, and finally narrow in on nurdles (a specific microplastic) helped me stick with this topic. 
3. **Displaying data is easy, but telling a story is hard.** As cheesy as this is given the title of the course, it's very true. Before taking this class, I assumed *telling a story* with data simply met making a very easy to follow visual that someone could easily interpret. However, this project has taught me otherwise. Telling a story with data often involves multiple different datasets, visuals, supportive language, and imagery. Although my final product is complete, I believe there is still so much to this "story" that can be added. I hope people will continue to use my website as a resource or starting point into looking into the issues of microplastics.
