# Final Project, Part 3
For the final part of my final project, I finished my website on shorthand using data from the user research I completed and presented to my class.

Make sure to check out parts 1 and 2 of my final project before reading on if you haven't already!

## What I changed
After receiving user feedback in part 2, I set out to make changes in order of most feasible with the highest value to the reader. This is detailed on the graph made at the bottom of part 2. My first two priorities were using more visuals (including some sort of size dimension comparison for a microplastic) and finding a better quality picture of nurdles. 

The two visuals I made were on [infogram](www.infogram.com), with one being a pictoral representation of a percentage (only 9% of all plastic being recylced annually) and the other being a size comparison. The size comparison infogram was a little bit trickier to create, because I had to do some googling and estimating of common things that people could imagine in their head that could be easily measured in millimeters. I ended up choosing a penny (which is about 20 millimeters in diameter), so I made the size comparison by manually entering in data of 20 to 5. I verbally told my audience that the microplastic could be that size *or smaller*.
